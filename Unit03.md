**Unit 3: Classical Economics** <span id="3"></span> 
*The classical economics period spanned from 1776 to the
mid-19<sup>th</sup> century. Economists of the time tried to explain the
changes in their environment as workers moved from farms to
factories. Markets became more developed, and new pricing models
explained the value of goods and services. Adam Smith plays a special
role in the transition from mercantilism to classical economics: his
work is much like a pair of bookends. In the last unit, we examined the
role that Adam Smith played in ending mercantilist thought. As you will
learn in this unit, he also paved the way for intellectual inquiry into
the classical era. His masterwork, titled* An Inquiry into the Nature
and Causes of the Wealth of Nations*, was a clarion call for liberating
human initiative and channeling it through the mechanism of the market,
or what Smith metaphorically called theinvisible hand. *  
  
 *Adam Smith influenced David Ricardo as he developed many of the
principle ideas of classical economics, including the labor theory of
value, the law of diminishing returns in agricultural production, and
the law of comparative advantage. Jeremy Bentham later emerged as a
prominent economic and social thinker; his theory of utilitarianism
famously framed the role and nature of government. Meanwhile, another
classical economist, Karl Marx, analyzed communal economics and the
relationship between capital (factories and machines) and human labor.
The works of these classical economists echo modern times: Ricardo’s
theories form the basis for theories of globalization; Bentham’s
philosophy is the bedrock of liberal democracy; and Marx’s ideas would
famously constitute the foundation of communism. In addition, you will
read the works of Jean-Baptiste Say, the French Ricardo, and will become
acquainted with the thought of the United States’ Alexander Hamilton,
all of whom wrote during this period.*

    Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations*, Books I–III**

    and Causes of the Wealth of
    Nations*](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/ECON301-2.3.2.pdf),
    Books I–III *(PDF)*  
        
     Instructions: Read the first three books of the *Wealth of Nations*
    on pages 7–412*.* In these books, you will see how Smith lays out
    his framework for a free market society. This reading is lengthy, so
    it is recommended that you break up the assigned reading over the
    course of one or two weeks.   
        
     As you read, note how he breaks down the *stock*, or capital, into
    its constituent parts, and consider the following study questions
    and their implications: How does he view slavery from an economic
    perspective? What does Smith mean when he describes the free market
    as an *invisible hand*? What do you think about his ideas on
    division of labor?  
        
     Reading these books and answering the study questions should take
    approximately 25 hours.

     Instructions: Read *Principles of Political Economy and Taxation.*
    This reading is lengthy, so it is recommended that you break up the
    assigned reading over the course of one or two weeks. This text
    provides a fundamental framework for describing a wide range of
    economic activities. Ricardo’s *labor theory of value*, for example,
    explains the concept of comparative advantage and specialization of
    labor. These concepts can be applied to free trade among nations or
    to the division of household labor. Staunch capitalists often cite
    Ricardo and his work as evidence of the power of free markets.
    Curiously, Marxists and communists have also pointed to Ricardo’s
    work to justify their own theories. The flexibility of his theory is
    a testament to his timeless contribution to economics.    
        
     As you read, consider the following study questions: How does
    Ricardo assign value to labor and his description of how taxation
    affects well-being? In what ways does Ricardo cite Smith in his
    text?  
        
     Reading this text and answering the study questions should take
    approximately 18 hours.  
        
     Terms of Use: *Principles of Political Economy and Taxation* is in

     Instructions: Read the preface and the first five chapters of
    Bentham’s *An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and
    Legislation* on pages 1–26*.* Bentham was a contemporary of
    Smith. Note how Bentham introduces the concept of utility as it
    relates to human perception. His later works, particularly *The
    Rationale of Reward* (1825) and *The Rationale of Punishment*
    (1830), go on to detail a type of calculus for measuring individual
    and social happiness. These form the basis for much of modern
    economic thought on choice theory and utility.  
        
     Reading the preface and these chapters should take approximately 1
    hour and 30 minutes.

    [“Preface”](http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/preface.htm) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read the preface from Karl Marx’s *A Contribution to
    the Critique of Political Economy*, written in 1859*.* This reading
    constitutes a sketch of Marx’s framework for historical materialism.
    He argues that the nature of a society’s economic structure depends
    upon the degree of development of the productive forces or means of
    production, meaning human labor conjoined with technology. The
    nature of the economic structure explains the relations of
    production or superstructure, meaning the political and legal
    institutions of society. Revolution occurs, however, when the forces
    of production are stifled by the superstructure, which is replaced
    by a structure better suited to preside over the continued
    development of the forces of production.  
        
     Reading the preface should take approximately 15 minutes.  
        
     Terms of Use: *A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy*

    Commodity”](http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/ch01.htm) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Read part 1 of Marx’s *A Contribution to the Critique
    of Political Economy.* Marx begins by establishing two necessary
    conditions for commodity production: a market and a social division
    of labor where people make different things. For Marx, commodities
    both have a use-value and an exchange-value or price, but it is the
    latter which is problematic. In coming to understand why one
    commodity is priced differently than another, Marx derives his labor
    theory of value.

     Instructions: Read chapter 14 of Marx’s *Capital.* Marx shows the
    effects of his law that within a capitalist economic structure, the
    tendency of the rate of profit must fall. This leads to increasing
    intensity of exploitation as well as other effects that contribute
    to the downfall of capitalism.

     Instructions: Read part 4 of Marx’s *Critique of the Gotha

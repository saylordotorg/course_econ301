**Unit 1: Ancient Economic Thought** <span id="1"></span> 
*Historians are limited by the documents civilizations leave behind. The
earliest examples of recorded history came from the Ancient Near East,
between the Nile and the Euphrates, beginning around the 29<sup>th</sup>
century, BCE. Texts from nearly five thousand years ago detail many of
the same economic choices we make today, addressing issues like how to
measure productivity and output, how to determine the standard unit of
economic value, and how best to divide private property. In fact, one of
the first known examples of writing was a tax receipt inscribed on a
clay tablet in what is present-day Uzbekistan.*  
  
 *Economic ideas have been combined with political, philosophical, and
social thought to create general observations about human society. The
first economist may have been Fan Li, a pharmacist and royal adviser in
the Chinese state of Yue in the 9<sup>th</sup> century BCE. In the
4<sup>th</sup> century BCE, the Greeks gave birth to the term*
*oeconomicus, which described household economics, agriculture, and
slavery. Around the same time, Indian thought on economics was
chronicled by* *Kautilya*, also known as Chanakya, in his lengthy work**
Arthashastra*. Later, in the 11<sup>th</sup> century, Islamic thought on
economics emerged; the most notable scholar was a Persian,
Al-Ghazali. From a historical perspective, you should work to recognize
and trace this cross-cultural evolution of economic thought.*  
  
 *As you review the materials in this unit, think about the similarities
and differences in the various approaches to economic thought. Remember
that ideas may develop independently or may be influenced by earlier
authors. Consider how our modern-day assumptions influence our
perceptions of these ancient economists and philosophers.*

    Thought before Adam Smith*: [“Chapter 1: The First
    Philosopher-Economists: The
    Greeks”](http://mises.org/books/histofthought1.pdf)(PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the first chapter of the libertarian political
    philosopher Murray N. Rothbard’s *Economic Thought before Adam
    Smith* on pages 1–27. Although Rothbard is intent on presenting an
    interpretation of past scholarship that supports aspects of
    contemporary libertarian economic political thought, in this first
    chapter he gives a general overview of Hesiod on scarcity;
    Democritus on subjective value and utility, the influence of supply
    and demand on value and on time-preference; Plato and Xenophon on
    the division of labor; Plato on the functions of money; and
    Aristotle on supply and demand, money, exchange, and the imputation
    of valuefrom ends to means. Rothbard writes that all of these
    scholars were focusing on the logicalimplications of a few broadly
    empirical axioms of human life: the existenceof human action, the
    eternal pursuit of goals by employing scarce means, and thediversity
    and inequality among men. He concludes the chapter with a subsection
    on political and economic thought in ancient China.  
        
     Reading this chapter should take approximately 2 hours.

     Instructions: Read the biography of Fan Li as well as the 24 rules
    for business. These rules were written in the 5<sup>th</sup> century
    BCE, about the same time as the classical Greek works to follow. The
    author was both an adviser to the imperial court and a practitioner
    of medicine.

**1.2.2 Xenophon** <span id="1.2.2"></span> 
-   **Reading: Project Gutenberg: Xenophon’s *The Economist***
    Link: Project Gutenberg: Xenophon’s *[The
    Economist](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1173/1173-h/1173-h.htm) *(HTML)  
        
     Also available in:  
     [Google
    Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=CVoJAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Economist+Xenophon&hl=en&ei=SGJlTYifJ4KC8ga_qOWEBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&sqi=2&ved=0CD8Q6AEwAQ)  
        
     Instructions: Read *The Economist*, written as a dialogue between
    Socrates and Critobulus, the son of one of Socrates’s
    disciples. Socrates asks questions, and Critobulus answers
    them. This format is typical of many Greek writings designed to
    present and explain ideas. Notice that when Critobulus asks
    questions, Socrates replies with a story from Ischomachus, a
    gentleman farmer. Many historians believe that Ischomachus
    represents the author’s own thoughts. In other words, it does not
    matter much who the speakers are; the entire work is a way for
    Xenophon to express his ideas. Why wouldn’t Xenophon directly write
    his thoughts in his own voice? Remember what happened to Socrates,
    who was condemned to death; it was less risky to hide behind the
    mask of characters.  
        
     In the author’s translation, we learn about Xenophon: “Xenophon the
    Athenian was born 431 B.C. He was a pupil of Socrates. He marched
    with the Spartans and was exiled from Athens. Sparta gave him land
    and property in Scillus, where he lived for many years before having
    to move once more to settle in Corinth. He died in 354 B.C.”  
        
     In terms of economics, think about how Xenophon discusses managing
    a household and agriculture. Pay particular attention to how goods
    are valued and what constitutes a fair exchange.    
        
     Reading this dialogue should take approximately 5 hours.  
        
     Terms of Use: *The Economist* is in the public domain.

**1.2.3 Aristotle** <span id="1.2.3"></span>

     [PDF](http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/aristotl.htm)  
        
     Instructions: Read book 7 of Aristotle’s *Politics.* Aristotle was
    born three to four generations after Xenophon. His work is best
    known for introducing the scientific method and for breaking down
    the complex into its basic parts. Aristotle’s writing style is
    direct. Note that he does not use the dialogue technique that we saw
    in Xenophon’s work.  
        
     Reflect on how Aristotle describes the nature of happiness and the
    role of material goods. As you read, consider the following study
    question: How does Aristotle’s view of social mobility reflect the
    concept of comparative advantage?  
        
     Reading this book and answering the study question should take
    approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes.

**1.2.4 India** <span id="1.2.4"></span> 
-   **Reading: Fordham University’s *Internet Indian History
    Sourcebook*: Excerpts from Kautilya’s *The Arthashastra***
    Link: Fordham University’s *Internet Indian History Sourcebook*: **
    Excerpts from Kautilya’s *[The
    Arthashastra](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ECON301-1.3.pdf) (*PDF)  
        
     Also available in:  

    [EPUB](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/ECON301-1.3-Arthashastra-Chanakya.epub)  
      
     Instructions: Read the selected excerpts from books 1–4 of
    *Arthashastra.* The authorship of the work is the source of some
    debate amongst historians. Kautilya, also known as Chanakya, may
    have been the prime minister of an Indian empire in the
    3<sup>rd</sup> century BCE, although some scholars trace the work to
    some 500 years later.   
        
     As you read, consider the following study questions: How does the
    author view the role of women and marriage? How may slaves have been
    treated in their role as economic participants, as the work focuses
    on economic punishments for disobeying ethical imperatives?  
        
     Reading these excerpts and answering the study questions should
    take approximately 45 minutes.

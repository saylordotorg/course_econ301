**Unit 2: European Thought: Scholastics and Mercantilists** <span
id="2"></span> 
*The late Scholastics, adherents to the school of thought known as
Scholasticism that was active in Spain from the 14<sup>th</sup> to the
17<sup>th</sup> centuries, sought to reconcile economic logic with the
Christian morality of their day and argued that markets were both
practically and morally superior to state-run economies. The school was
ahead of its time in formulating concepts, such as marginal utility, and
in investigating the ideas of subjective value, prices, and the quantity
theory of money. Nearly 400 years before Adam Smith, San Bernardino of
Siena (1380–1444) asserted that prices were a function of relative
scarcity. Similarly, the Jesuit scholar Luis de Molina (1535–1600)
argued that a* *just pricewas a price set on a voluntary market. At the
same time, Islamic economic scholars in the Muslim empire, having
continued the work of Greco-Roman economic thought from the lands under
its domain, sought to integrate the principles developed from that
tradition with the teachings of their Holy Book, the Qu’ran, thus
paralleling the effort of the Scholastics.*  
  
 *The 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> centuries saw a transition
from local to national economies, the collapse of feudalism, the
subsequent rise of merchant capitalism, and the emergence of extensive
foreign commerce. The opening of silver mines in the Americas increased
the flow of metal, meaning that there was more metal that could be used
as currency. These new sources of wealth effectively expanded the scope
of economic activities across time and distance, replacing barter trade
and extending the division of labor beyond local boundaries.*  
  
 *Within this context, economists began to subscribe to a theory known
as* *mercantilism. Mercantilism favored the establishment of a strong,
central state that would help to expand markets and protect trade and
commercial interests. According to the theory, individuals are
considered subservient to the state, an entity that should control
wages, interest, and prices; grant monopoly privileges; and impose
various restrictions on the actions of individuals. Mercantilists
asserted that the primary focus of economic activity should be the
accumulation of wealth in the form of precious metals.*  
  
 *Mercantilist doctrine sought to ensure a surplus of precious metals by
favoring the export of goods and services over their import. As Adam
Smith and others subsequently pointed out, the aim of mercantilism was a
well-stocked royal treasury; rising consumption levels could be more
easily achieved through free exchange. In time, observers pointed out
various negative effects of mercantilism, and a host of critics began to
consider mercantilist policies a hindrance to economic progress. The
single greatest assault on mercantilist thinking is Adam Smith’s* The
Wealth of Nations *(1776).*

**2.1 The Scholastics** <span id="2.1"></span> 
**2.1.1 Overview** <span id="2.1.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: The Ludwig von Mises Institute: Murray N. Rothbard’s
    *Economic Thought before Adam Smith*: “Chapter 2: The Christian
    Middle Ages and Chapter 4: The Late Spanish Scholastics”**
    Link: The Ludwig von Mises Institute: Murray N. Rothbard’s *Economic
    Thought before Adam Smith*: [“Chapter 2: The Christian Middle Ages
    and Chapter 4: The Late Spanish
    Scholastics”](http://mises.org/books/histofthought1.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read Chapter 2 on pages 29–64 and chapter 4 on pages
    97–133. Throughout both chapters, Rothbard traces how various
    scholars from the end of the Roman Empire to end of the
    16<sup>th</sup> century fluctuate in their thinking across a range
    of economic issues regarding theory of value or what constitutes a
    just price; the legal status of usury, property rights, monetary
    theory and foreign exchange; and the status of merchants in society
    through the eyes of the church. You will be able to see how the
    precursors of concepts such as marginal price utility came to
    develop over time through a process of competing ideological notions
    and political influences and how historical developments and
    empirical pressures like the influx of gold and silver to Europe
    from the Americas affected economic thinking.  
        
     Reading these chapters should take approximately 5 hours.

     Instructions: Read these two excerpts from this seminal Scholastic
    work: “Of Cheating, Which Is Committed in Buying and Selling” and
    “Of the Sin of Usury.”   
        
     Born in Italy in the 13<sup>th</sup> century, Thomas Aquinas was
    perhaps the most influential Catholic scholar of his age and beyond.
    His writings are wide-ranging, and here, you should focus on what
    constitutes a *fair exchange*. At the time of these writings, many
    scholars were giving extensive consideration to the determination of
    a fair interest rate as seen in readings from subunit 2.1.1. It
    should be noted that the fixation on usury was also due in part to
    leading Islamic thought of the era, which argued for a complete
    prohibition on the charging of interest. Note how the format is
    similar to Xenophon’s dialogue – possibly a sign, however modest, of
    the revival of ancient Greek thought in the Christian Middle Ages.  
        
     Reading these excerpts should take approximately 1 hour.

     Instructions: This is a lengthy series of essays. Read through
    them, paying particular attention to Petty’s methods for calculating
    economic phenomena.  
        
     Petty may be considered one of the first *econometricians*, someone
    who uses mathematical techniques to develop economic statistics. He
    was an articulate proponent of mercantilism and lived during a
    vibrant period of English colonial expansion. The 1600s were a time
    of great wealth building but also of significant disparity. This
    text is concerned with collecting taxes and maximizing the nation’s
    colonization interests.

     [PDF](http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/adamsmith.htm)  
        
     Instructions: This massive work was both an attack on the
    principles of mercantilism and a discourse on moral and political
    philosophy. Read book 4, which specifically addresses
    mercantilism. You will read the first three books in subunit 3.1 as
    these cover the topic of classical economists.  
        
     Adam Smith lived in the 1700s, a time when England lost control
    over its American colonies. In part, his work is a reaction to his
    perception of the difficulties of managing colonies under a
    mercantilist system. Smith is cited by many historians as the most
    influential economist in history, because his writings are
    applicable to the problems faced by people in modern society.   
     Reading this book should take approximately 10 hours.

    Property”](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/POLSC2012.3.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Although considered more of a political philosopher,
    read Locke’schapter 5 on pages 15–25. Pay attention to how Locke’s
    notion of property rights is dependent upon his notion of
    self-ownership. Locke argues that we own, or have an entitlement to,
    what we make by mixing that which we already own – ourselves, and
    hence our own labor power – with that which we do not own. Locke
    believed that those who make something have property rights with
    respect to what they make just as God has property rights with
    respect to human beings because he is their maker. Human beings are
    created in the image of God and share with God, though to a lesser
    extent, the ability to shape and mold the physical environment
    around them.  
        
     Reading this chapter should take approximately 45 minutes.

    Cantillon”](http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Richard_Cantillon)
    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read the encyclopedic biography of Cantillon. Truly a
    post-Mercantilist thinker, Cantillon entered areas of economic
    analysis to which few of his predecessors and contemporaries had
    gone. Considered to be part of the French school of thought known as
    the *Physiocracy*, his work had more influence on British and
    Austrian economic thinkers coming after him than any one of his
    contemporaries.  
        
     Reading this biography should take approximately 30 minutes.

     Instructions: Read chapter 12 on pages 343–362 for information on
    Richard Cantillon and his influence on modern economics. Apart from
    Rothbard’s pointed thesis of promoting the importance of Cantillon
    to that of Adam Smith in the development of modern economic thought,
    Cantillon helped to codify economics as an independent area of
    investigation and wrote a general treatise on all of its aspects. As
    Rothbard remarks, one reason that Cantillon was the first of the
    moderns is that he emancipated economic analysis from ethical and
    political concerns, abstracting the economic features of human
    actions from other concerns, however important.

     Instructions: Read chapter 14 on pages 383–413. Turgot had the
    opportunity to practice his economics as a finance minister to King
    Louis XVI in the years before the French Revolution. His ideas were
    not shared entirely by his Physiocrat contemporaries, and he was one
    who supported the *ancien regime.* Like Cantillon, his ideas became
    part of the British classical tradition. Some even call him the
    first *capitalist* thinker because of his focus on financial and
    physical capital.

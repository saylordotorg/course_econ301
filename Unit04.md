**Unit 4: Neoclassicism, Keynesianism, and Post-War Economic Thought**
<span id="4"></span> 
*Modern thinking presents many challenges to historians. Because we lack
the perspective of time, it is unclear which ideas will emerge as
dominant strains of thought. Classifying new ideas into meaningful
agglomerations is an uncertain and tentative process. In the midst of a
contemporary debate, it is impossible to know which theories and debates
will survive and which will be overturned. With these limitations, unit
4 will broadly discuss the two main strains of mainstream economic
thought: neoclassicism and Keynesianism.*  
  
 *There is little agreement as to how to define a neoclassical
thinker. Neoclassicism is mostly a microeconomic discourse, meaning that
it only lightly considers the role of government. In general,
neoclassical thinkers assume that people will act rationally, that the
information needed to make decisions is available, and that people try
to maximize their utility while firms seek to maximize profit. Each of
these assumptions is simultaneously reasonable and flawed. Much debate
centers on how to modify or interpret these three concepts.*  
  
 *Keynesianism is better defined, because it is derived from a single
source: the writings of John Maynard Keynes. In general, Keynesians
recognize that the free market may generate inefficient outcomes on the
macroeconomic level. The economic role of government is fairly well
defined as interventionist seeking to stabilize the macroeconomy.*  
  
 *The relationship between neoclassicism and Keynesianism has been
dubbed the* *neoclassical synthesis.In other words, much of the
20<sup>th</sup> century has been devoted to understanding how these two
schools of thought relate. There is an emerging third school known as*
*monetarism, which was championed by the economist Milton Friedman.*

     Instructions: Read this article by Jevons. Active in the late
    19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> century England, Jevons
    was one of the early pioneers of the *marginal revolution* in
    economics, using a marginalist method for analyzing questions
    relating to the theories of value and distribution and later to
    theories of money, fluctuations, income determination, and growth.  
        
     Reading this article should take approximately 30 minutes.

     Instructions: Read book 1, book 3, chapter 13 of book 4, and book 5
    of Alfred Marshall’s *Principles of Economics.* Marshall provides a
    substantial exposition for the marginal revolution in economics,
    using a marginalist method for analyzing questions relating to the
    theories of value and distribution and later to theories of money,
    fluctuations, income determination, and growth.    
      
     Reading these books should take approximately 9 hours.

     Instructions: Read the preface and part 1 of *The Economics of
    Welfare.* Pigou, Marshall’s successor at Cambridge University,
    elaborates on Marshall’s views. Pigou is well known for his work on
    externalities and the *Pigouvian tax*, which was intended to cover
    the social costs of a market activity not covered by the private
    cost of an activity – an example being environmental pollution.    
        
     Reading the preface and part 1 should take approximately 4 hours.

    Theory of the Determination of Prices”**
    Link: Irving Fisher’s Translation of Léon Walras’s [“Geometrical
    Theory of the Determination of
    Prices”](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1008746?&Search=yes&searchText=Leon&searchText=Walras&list=hide&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoAdvancedSearch%3Fq0%3DLeon%2BWalras%26f0%3Dau%26c1%3DAND%26q1%3D%26f1%3Dall%26wc%3Don%26fc%3Doff%26Search%3DSearch%26sd%3D%26ed%3D%26la%3D%26pt%3D%26isbn%3D%26dc.Economics%3DEconomics&prevSearch=&item=4&ttl=25&returnArticleService=showFullText&&) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the article, “Geometrical Theory of the
    Determination of Prices,” which provides a graphical representation
    of general equilibrium theory initially put forth in the form of
    Walras’s 1874 work, *Elements of Pure Economics*. Walras was the
    first economist to construct a complete general equilibrium model
    encompassing exchange, production, consumption, capital formation,
    and money. He specified the interrelations between these phenomena,
    studied their disequilibrium behavior, and described their
    conditions of equilibrium.  
        
     Reading this article should take approximately 1 hour.

     Instructions: Read Pareto’s article, “The New Theories of
    Economics.” Pareto improved Walras’s comprehensive model and
    developed his own original theories. He agreed with Walras that the
    scope of pure economic theory is limited to facts and relationships
    where free will does not play a part and that the methods of
    positive science should be used in the study of all aspects of
    economics and of human behavior generally.  
        
     Reading this article should take approximately 1 hour.

     Instructions: Read Cassel’s article, “Further Observations on the
    World’s Monetary Problem.” Cassel used Walras’s conception of
    general economic equilibrium as a basis for his work and carried a
    number of the specific constructions of Walras and Pareto forward in
    the stream of economic studies.  
        
     Reading this article should take approximately 30 minutes.

     Instructions: Read Keynes’s *The General Theory of Employment,
    Interest, and Money.* Keynes was an influential British economist in
    the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. His work focuses on how to use

     Instructions: Read Hayek’s *The Road to Serfdom.* Friedrich von
    Hayek was an Austrian economist spending most of his career at the
    London School of Economics and the University of Chicago. Published
    in 1944, *The Road to Serfdom* is primarily an attack against
    centrally-planned economies. Hayek thought that government has a
    role to play with regard to the monetary system, labor regulation,
    and institutions to foster and protect freedom of information among
    other issues and principles.

    Keynesian Economics”, and “Chicago School (Economics)”**

     Instructions: Read these three encyclopedic entries, which give a
    synopsis of institutional economics, Keynesian economics, and its
    antithetical counterpart, the Chicago school. The latter developed
    primarily out of the Economics Department at the University of
    Chicago in the 1950s and is associated primarily with the work of
    one of its founders, Milton Friedman. Keynesian thought fully took
    hold both academically and practically after WWII; the influx of
    government war spending provided very strong evidence for Keynes
    theory vis-à-vis the Depression. For the “Keynesian Economics”
    reading, pay particular attention to the sections titled
    “Developments after Keynes” and “Legacy.”
